## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use the picture element in my markup, and I developed my understanding of using grid display and the focus pseudo class in CSS a bit more. 

### Continued development

I would like to further my understanding of using grid in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) has a few videos on the picture element as well as tons of CSS tips that have helped me out a lot on this project as well as others.
